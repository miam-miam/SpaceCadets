# Challenge 3

Last week we looked at Bare Bones, the simple language that Brookshear uses in his book, 'Computer
Science: an Overview'. Last week's challenge was to write an interpreter for Bare Bones that could
handle simple programs.

This week I want you to think about how you might extend the Bare Bones language itself. What
features do you miss the most?

## Suggested Methods

Examples:

- Comments
- Simple operators (+, -, /, *)
- if/else statements
- Sub routines
- Structures

Extend your interpreter with whatever you think is important, try and keep the syntax consistent.
Make sure you document your language extensions.

This exercise can be as complex or as simple as you like. If you feel a bit uncertain then have a go
at the first two points, if you feel a bit more confident then try one of the last three. Make sure
that you write and upload a demonstration Bare Bones program that uses your extension.

## Possible Extensions

Rather than writing the next C++ I'd like you to use any extra time you have to repeat your efforts to extend the Bare Bones language...but with someone else's interpreter. If you didn't get round to creating your own interpreter last week then this may be your only choice anyway!
