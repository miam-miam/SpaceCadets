# SpaceCadets

I took part in a competition where we had to produce solutions to weekly challenges using Java. Many
of the challenges were quite open-ended so I tried to always add some sort of extension or quirky
way of completing them. I ended up coming joint first with one
other [person](https://github.com/Constantin-Alexandru) out of 50.

Highlights include:
- [An encrypted chat server using a Caesar cipher](challenge4) 
- [A spirograph generator using ASCII art](challenge5)
- [A GPU accelerated circle detector](challenge6)
- [An OS that can run asynchronous BareBones programs](challenge8)
