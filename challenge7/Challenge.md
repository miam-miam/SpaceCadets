# Challenge 7

Android application development uses Java as its language, although after being compiled to Java
bytecode, they are translated into Dalvik bytecode to run on the Dalvik VM which exists within the
Android operating system.

Create a mobile application that takes advantage of your core skills. Pick one of these options

- Metadata mining
- Communication
- Computer vison
- Video Game

Make sure it's done to high quality and on time.

## Suggested Methods

We highly recommend using Android Studio and an Android Emulator. If your emulator is running slow
try lowering the resolution and Android version.

## Possible Extensions

Some ideas for inspiration:

- An Android interface for any of our previous Space Cadets challenges
    - An Android ECS people lookup
    - An Android animated text or spirograph (could you make drawing the spirograph interactive on
      the touch screen?)
    - An Android bare bones interpreter (think about how you could make a touch interface for
      creating bare bones code)
    - An Android IRC or messaging client
- A Flappy birds clone or similarly simple game
- An awareness app like Here or Not
